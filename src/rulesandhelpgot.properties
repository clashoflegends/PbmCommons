The winner will get a 1-15 increase in one of his skills as a reward.\nThere is no limit on how many challenges a single duelist can take part in during a single turn.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.RCDUELO=Refuse all Personal Challenges
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.RCDUELO.CENARIO6=All personal challenges will be refused during the current turn. The assumption is that all characters will accept all challenges every time, unless this command is issued.\nChallenges are resolved in order from the highest challenger rank to the lowest.\nIf you are challenged and refuse to engage while commanding an army, the army\u2019s morale will drop by 1-15 points.\nThis action will be ignored if the PC also challenges someone else to a duel.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.M.DUELOS=-- Personal Duel --
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.DUELOS.CENARIO7=All challenges are executed. All duels are fought to death.

Unfortunately, is not unusual to hear that some apprentice died while trying to cast too many hard spells.\nNote that the chances of dying as result of lost combats are greatly increased by casting combat spells. If someone is taking the risk to cast combat spells, they better make sure they win the combat.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.FEITDEFENSE=Cast Army Defense Spell
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.FEITDEFENSE.CENARIO11=The wizard conjures powerful protection aura to defend troops during battle. The damage taken by the army is reduced by 20 points per each wizard\u2019s skill. The caster must be traveling with the army for the spell to affect the combat. \nExample: A wizard with a skill rank of 50 will have 1000 defense points added to the army. \nIf multiple spells are cast, their effects will be added together.\nAll spells cast will drain life points from the caster according to the spells\u2019 difficulty and how many spells were cast in the same turn.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DEFEND.CENARIO6=The army is commanded to hold its position in case of attack. It does not initiate combat, but allows the army to choose a tactic other than standard in case someone else initiates the combat.\nAll other behavior remains the same as in a regular combat.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.DSTCP=Raze City
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DSTCP.CENARIO9=The army is commanded to attack the enemy city at the same hex. The attack is mean to raze and pillage the city if the attacking armies are strong enough.\nIf there are any defending armies or navies from the name nation as the city, a battle between the armies will take place and be resolved right before the attack on the city begins.\nAny defending allies (different nation than the city) must initiate the attack in order to be part of the city defenses. Or they will just stand and watch.\nAttacking catapults will have a free strike against the city\u2019s fortification before the city\u2019s attack, but after any armies\u2019 battles. If catapults are in enough numbers it is possible for them to reduce, or even completely remove a city\u2019s fortification before the main army's regular attack.\nIf the defending armies are defeated and the attack on the city is initiated, the city will be considered under siege for the remaining of the turn even if not destroyed. Some actions fail when a city is under siege, such as sells and recruit.\nIf the attacking armies win the battle against the city, the city will be razed to ruins. The surviving armies will pillage the food and metals for armors and weapons. Other resources and gold will be sent to the nearest city of the surviving razing army\u2019s nation as result of the pillages. Not even the fortifications will remain. \nThe amount of gold pillaged will be proportional to the size of the city and fortifications, plus a percentage of the nation\u2019s overall treasury. Razing a capital would generate twice the gold.\nA nation that has a city razed by an enemy will experience an overall drop in loyalty. As you can imagine, the impact of having the capital razed is much worse and often leading to a nation\u2019s economic elimination.\nVictory will improve the skills of any chars traveling with the army. Also, it will improve the army\u2019s morale and training.\nOn the other hand, be traveling with an army is risk business. All chars can be harmed or killed during combat, even if the combat is won.\nOf course, the city cannot be hidden for an enemy army to be able to attack it. Note that there must be a surviving army with land troops to carry out any raze's spoils as ships don't participate against a city's attack.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.CAPTCP=Capture City
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CAPTCP.CENARIO6=The army is commanded to attack the enemy city at the same hex. The attack is mean to capture the city if the attacking armies are strong enough.\nIf there are any defending armies or navies from the name nation as the city, a battle between the armies will take place and be resolved right before the attack on the city begins.\nAny defending allies must initiate the attack in order to be part of the city defenses.\nArchers will have double strength while defending their nation\u2019s city. Food will be captured by the winning side. All other troops will be destroyed.\nIf the defending armies are defeated and the attack on the city is initiated, the city will be considered under siege for the remaining of the turn even if not captured.\nIf the attacking armies win the battle against the city, the city will be under the ownership of the strongest army attacking it. All stores and improvements will remain, as well as the fortifications if they were not damaged by catapults. The city will be reduced by one size. If the city if at the minimum size before the attack, it will be destroyed.\nAttacking catapults will have a free strike against the city\u2019s fortification before the city\u2019s attack, but after any armies\u2019 battles. If catapults are in enough numbers it is possible for them to reduce, or even remove a city\u2019s fortification.\nVictory will improve the skills of any chars traveling with the army. Also, it will improve the army\u2019s morale and training.\nOn the other hand, traveling with an army is risk business. All chars can be harmed or killed during combat, even if the combat is won.\nOf course, the city cannot be hidden for an enemy army to be able to attack it.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.ATAQNPC=Npc Attack
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ATAQNPC.CENARIO6=The NPC army is commanded to attack all enemies at the same hex, including any garrison present. Non enemies will be ignored unless they initiate combat. \nIf there is a city, then the army attack will focus on the city\u2019s nation. Others will be ignored unless they start combat.\nIn most cases, the army will only initiate combat if there is a chance of winning, but some overly aggressive types will initiate combat even if suicidal.\nCombats end only when there are no enemies left to battle to both sides. \nAn army cannot initiate the attack on a navy. The navy can initiate the attack on an army only if it can land its troops.\nNavy combat happens before army combat.\nNPCs can move and attack with garrisons, they are fully functional only for NPCs.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.M.COMBATES=-- Army Combat --
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.COMBATES.CENARIO7=When the Judge reaches this milestone, it will resolve all army battles following this sequence:\n- First: water phase, navy against navy battles takes place. The navy definition is any army with enough ships for all its troops.\n- Second: land phase, army against army battles takes place. Depending on the situation, a navy will drop anchor and disembark troops to battle as an army.\n- Third: city phase, surviving armies against city battles takes place.\n\nThe combat goes in rounds. Each round, the attack force is used to calculate the damage dealt to the opposing side, reducing its defense force (killing soldiers). Both sides\u2019 attacks are considered to be simultaneous. It is possible that both sides eliminated themselves in a given round.\nSome units have the first strike ability, like archers, allowing then one extra attack before the battle begins. They are the only troops that will cause damage on the respective phase\u2019s round 0. \nIf the navy battle takes place over water as opposed to river bank or any land, all PCs in the losing side will drown (be killed) after the combat unless they have ways to prevent it. Some magic items or spells may grant this capability in specific scenarios. Otherwise, the army will land, but a percentage of the troops will still drown.\nIf a navy engage in land combat for any reason, then the navy will drop anchor. This means that all ships will be removed from the army and left in the same hex as a garrison. This is important to understand as the ships cannot be transferred or somehow manipulated until they are attached back to the army, which can happen by an action to pick up the troops from the garrison or if an army without enough ships from the same nation receives the command to sail away. The Sail action will attach all ships back to the army, if the army does not have enough ships to sail, but a garrison in the same hex does.\nNote that a land army will fail to initiate combat against a navy. Also, that an army from a different nation has to issue the attack order to participate on city defense.\nCity phase: After defeating all defending armies and if the army\u2019s current attack force is greater than the city\u2019s defense, and then the city is captured or destroyed, according to the command given. Meaning that the city phase is resolved in a single round of combat Therefore the sum of the attacking armies\u2019 strength must beat the city\u2019s defense in one single round. Spells and magic items might help.\nSiege weapons can fight on city phase\u2019s round 0 and they might reduce the city\u2019s fortifications before the main army begins, therefore reducing the city\u2019s defense.\nThe army\u2019s attack and defense forces are calculated by adding up all platoons\u2019 attack and defense, respectively and they can be affected by spells, magic items, tactics, diplomatic relations, commander\u2019s skill, morale and terrain.\nThe formula to calculate a platoon attack is: (Unit strength for the terrain) * ((weapons + training + 100)/3) * (# of troops)\nOn Combat Tactics:\nEach army commander can give orders to the army regarding which tactic to use while engaging the enemy on the battle field. All platoons will perform the same but casualties sequence will be assigned according to the tactics than another. If the commander doesn\u2019t specify the tactics, the army will engage all enemies in a standard formation. Look for a tactics vs. tactics table in the rulebook.\nAny characters traveling with an army that loses a battle have a chance of dying. The chances are based on the total number of characters traveling with the commander and greatly increased for the characters casting any combat spells.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MUDIMP=Change Tax Rate
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MUDIMP.CENARIO9=Inform to your tax collectors how much they would take away from the population. Higher the taxes, higher the stead income from cities and faster the city\u2019s loyalty will drop each turn. Lower taxes will increase loyalty each turn. Moreover, when the population first hears that the taxes are being raised, the loyalty immediately will drop in each city. If the taxes are being lowered, the opposite effect will be noticed.\nIf a nation, at any time, doesn\u2019t have enough gold in its treasury to pay for its upkeep, the taxes will be raised automatically to find the funds. Costs associated with actions will not force the taxes up, but the action will fail for lack of funds. In this case, the loyalty drop on all cities is even bigger due the acknowledgement of poor administration by the regent.\nATTENTION: if at any given moment the taxes are raised above 100%, the nation is considered eliminated from the game.\nThe attempt will be paid with gold from nation's treasury even if not successful.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.M.PRODUCAO=-- Resource Gathering --
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.PRODUCAO.CENARIO7=Cities gather resources then they are added to city's stores. Resources gathering can be influenced by the size of the city (larger the city, smaller the production) and climate. A city under siege does not gather any resources, including gold and taxes.\nAlso, at this point the loyalty is adjusted for all cities, based on current taxes. City decay/flip is checked.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.INCTAX=Collect Extra Taxes

DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.VENDNAC=Sell Resources from All Cities
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.VENDNAC.CENARIO6=A character at the capital can command all nations\u2019 cities to sell the same percentage of a given resource from their stores.\nIf the city doesn\u2019t have the resource in its stores, then it will not be part of the sells. If the city in under siege, then it cannot trade with the market. If the capital is under siege, it can command other cities to sell, but it cannot sell its own resources.

If the assassin's skill level is 85 or more, death is not likely to occur unless the assassin is previously injured. Also, be aware of body guards protecting the target as they can easily track the helpless caster in the vicinity. A wizard guarding the target would have higher chances than a rogue or commander to protect the target against this assassin.\nAll spells cast will drain life points from the caster according to the spells\u2019 difficulty and how many spells were cast in the same turn.

Meaning that a following recruitment could fail due lack of available troops or muster can fail due a previous recruitment. The muster will not recruit any troops it cannot recruit in a normal action; in this case the city will not recruit any soldier into its garrison.\nAlso, the garrison will try to load up to 4 units of food for each recruited unit, consuming the food from the city\u2019s stores.\nA city under siege will not provide any troops to armies.\nBe careful as the new armies can force your finances into bankruptcy as the number of troops that will be recruited can be quite large, so their upkeep costs.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.RECTROPAS=Recruit Troops
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.RECTROPAS.CENARIO7=Troops can be recruited from the city militia into the nation\u2019s army. If the PC is not traveling with an army, one army will be created under his/her command. If other PCs are traveling with him/her, they will automatically be traveling with the army.\n\nThe cost of creating a new army (check the game features, usually 2k or 5k) will be deducted from the nation treasury to cover the army creation costs. Some nations may have the ability to create new armies for free. You can avoid this cost by splitting your current armies.\n \nThe amount of troops that can be recruited in a given city at the same turn is limited to the militia size and available resources. A city under siege will not provide any troops to armies. A city is able to provide troops to armies as bellow:\n\tCamp: 100 troops.\n\tVillage: 200 troops.\n\tTown: 300 troops.\n\tBurgh: 400 troops.\n\tMetropolis: 500 troops.\nMultiple recruit actions are possible at the same city, but they all count against the same limit. Remember that the order that the recruit action is executed is random. \nYes, ships and catapults are also considered units and count against this limit.\nWhen recruiting troops with better armor or weapons, they are becoming more powerful and efficient with a higher attack or defense force. Of course, you need to have enough available resources in the city\u2019s stores: One unit of the resource for each troop recruited.\n\nHere are some examples of generic troops and a few characteristics. For a full list of units and specific characteristics for this scenario, check the Counselor Units Tab. \nHeavy Cavalry is the ultimate striking force on open field. Not as much on mountains, forests and swamps.\nFor each cavalry unit to be recruited, the city needs to have in its stores 2 units of leather and one unit of mounts.\nThe upkeep for these troops is 2 food units and 6 gold pieces per unit every turn.\n\nScouts are the eyes of the army, increasing the army\u2019s visibility by one hex in each direction. Most effective in deserts and hills, lose some of its power on mountains and forests.\nFor each scout unit to be recruited, the city needs to have in its stores one unit of leather and one unit of mounts.\nThe upkeep for these troops is 2 food units and 3 gold pieces per unit every turn.\n\nHeavy infantry is the backbone of any regular army. They perform quite well in almost any terrain. The disadvantage becomes more evident in rough terrains, like mountains, swamps and forests.\nThe upkeep for these troops is 1 food unit and 4 gold pieces per unit every turn.\n\nRegular Infantry shines in rough terrains like mountains, forests and swamps. Actually they can beat any other troops of similar size in these terrains.\nThe upkeep for these troops is 1 food unit and 2 gold pieces per unit every turn.\n\nArchers are great for defending cities. They receive an extra bonus when defending a city from their nation, or an allied city. Moreover, they receive one extra free attack at the beginning of any combat. Yes, if you have enough archers you can destroy an enemy army without suffering a single hit.\nThe upkeep for these troops is 1 food unit and 2 gold pieces per unit every turn.\n\nSlaves are very lousy and poorly trained troops. But hey, they don\u2019t ask for salaries!\nThe upkeep for these troops is 1 food per unit every turn and they don\u2019t demand gold.\n\nCatapults are not the most effective troops against other troops, but they are the ultimate weapon against fortifications. Before any city attack, the catapults receive an extra free attack against the city\u2019s fortification. If you have enough catapults, the fortifications would be reduced, or even removed, before the other troops charge through the city\u2019s gates.\nFor each catapult to be built, the city needs to have in its stores 500 units of wood, but they are upkeep free as they don\u2019t demand either food or gold.\nIf the quantity of troops is not informed or zero, the Judge will assume that the intention is to recruit the maximum amount. If your intention is to load food but not recruit troops, make sure you chose a troop type that cannot be recruited at the moment, such as ships and catapults when no wood is present, or cavalry when mounts are not available.\n
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.TRTROP.SPLIT=Transfer Troops/Split army
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.TRTROP.CENARIO7=Any commander traveling with the army can transfer some (or all) troops to another commander from the same nation in the same hex.\nIf the target commands an army, the transferred troops will be added to the target's army and then armor and weapons will be adjusted according. Otherwise, a new army will be created under the target's command. An army created this way has no cost associated with it.\nIf the troops are being transferred to or from a navy, the navy must be able to anchor to load and unload the troops. I.e. Troops cannot be transferred from a navy to an army in a hex where the navy can't land or attack.\nAny existing food will be split and transferred according to the relative quantity of troops being transferred. The new army resulting from the split will move as fed or not fed as the original army, unless the new army contains only troops that do not consume food such as ships and catapults.\nIf the target cannot be found (i.e. died), the troops will form a garrison or join an existing one. Troops can also be transferred into a garrison, if requested. A garrison will be created if necessary.\nAny other PCs traveling with the original army will remain traveling with the original leader.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.DSPTROP=Retire Troops
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DSPTROP.CENARIO6=Disbands the selected amount of troops from the army the PC is traveling with. Please, notice that the upkeep cost will still be paid for as this action happens after the upkeep phase.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.TRTROPNAT=Transfer Troops to Another Nation
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.TRTROPNAT.CENARIO9=Any commander traveling with the army can transfer some (or all) troops to an army from another allied nation in the same hex.\nNot all troops can be transferred between nations. Check the troops\u2019 abilities. \nIf the troops are being transferred to a navy, the navy must be able to anchor to load the troops.\nAny existing food will be split and transferred according to the relative amount of troops being transferred.\nIf no target PC is defined or if the target cannot be found (i.e. died), the troops will stay in the original army. \nAny other PCs traveling with the original army will remain traveling with the original leader.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MANEX=Put Army on Maneuvers
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MANEX.CENARIO9=The army will be put to training by executing training maneuvers and morale will increase. If the army is issue by the army\u2019s commander, all troops and other commanders traveling with the army will benefit from the training. \nThe troop\u2019s training stat can be raised (1-10) by executing training maneuvers. \nThe commander commanding the training will always benefit from the training (1-5), but all other commanders (1-5) traveling with the army will benefit as well if the army leader is commanding the maneuvers. If a commander traveling with the army, but not the leader, is commanding the maneuvers, then only his/her skill will improve (1-7) and only the strongest troops will be trained. \nNote that it is possible for different commanders at the same army to use this action multiple times each turn. The effects will stack.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.M.NPCRECRUIT=-- NPC recruit --
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.NPCRECRUIT.CENARIO11=At this point, the NPC nations will recruit. Note that NPC follow special rules. They can recruit without an army commander and always find the resources they need for troops.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.FORTCP=Fortify City
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.FORTCP.CENARIO6=The city is commanded to improve its fortification by one level.\nHere are the values for each fortification level. (Gold, Wood, Defense)\nTower: 1000, 1000, 2000\nFort: 3000, 3000, 6000\nCastle: 5000, 5000, 10000\nKeep: 8000, 8000, 16000\nFortress: 12000, 12000, 24000\nThe gold will be deduced from the nation\u2019s treasury if the upgrade is successful. The wood will be deduced from the city\u2019s stores. The defense value is the bonus the fortification will add to the city. Any attackers will have to beat this number with their armies\u2019 attack strength.\nIf successful, the character will receive a skill bonus.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.ULTIMATUM=Ultimatum to the City
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ULTIMATUM.CENARIO9=The army is commander to lay siege to the enemy non-hidden city and give the city an ultimatum demanding the city\u2019s immediate surrender.\nIf the population believes in the ultimatum and that resisting is futile, then they will drop their current flag and join the army\u2019s nation. Even if the city doesn\u2019t surrender, there is a chance that the siege will be successful. In this case, no resources will be received or sent from or to the city and most construction work and creation of new armies will fail as well.\nIf the army has enough catapults, the fortifications can be reduced as part of the siege.\nBy the way, a massive amount of catapults seems to be quite effective to convince the population to surrender. On the other hand, a capital is less likely to surrender without a fight.\nThe mere presence of any army of the same nation as the city (or from a nation that considers the army as an enemy) at the point that the ultimatum takes place is enough to convince the population not to surrender.\nSuccess depends on the army strength, army\u2019s leader commander skill, city\u2019s loyalty, city\u2019s size and fortifications.\nThis command does not initiate combat between armies and city.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.M.CUSTOMSTART=-- Custom starting packages --
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.CUSTOMSTART.CENARIO11=This milestone is only applicable on games with custom startup packages.\nOn turn 0, the Counselor will offer a chance to select the packages. Look for the \u201cstartup\u201d tab.\nOn turn 1, BEFORE any other milestone or action is executed, the Judge will apply the effects of each package, and then process all other actions for turn 1.\n=== Custom startup package selection on turn 0, for turn 1 ===\nThere are many options to customize your nation. All packages are listed on the \u201cstartup\u201d tab, which is only available on turn 0. \nThe packages can be a combination of special powers, extra troops, extra resources, characters or anything else. The packages cost 30, 60 or 90 points each. A player can select any combination of packages up to a total of 90 points. Meaning: 3x30, 30+60 or 1x 90.\nSome packages are listed as \u201cNATIONNAME special\u201d, meaning that only that nation can select this package. i.e. \u201cTyrell special\u201d can only be applied to House Tyrell.\nIMPORTANT: Please, mind that the Counselor is still evolving to better support the players. If an invalid selection is made (too many packages, invalid special, etc.) then the Judge will simply ignore the selection and the nation will have partial or no packages. The GM will not add them later to fix a player\u2019s mistake. Make sure you double check all your choices.\nEach package is self-explanatory; if you have questions, please ask your teammates or the GM team.\n\n=== Package execution on turn 1 ===\nOn turn 1, the Judge will apply all startup packages to each nation in no particular sequence. This will be the very first to happen on turn 1 before anything else.\nMeaning that troops will show up, gold will be added to treasure, cities will appear, nation powers will be added, etc.\nTroops will be added to the capital\u2019s army unless otherwise stated. And they will move or act as part of the army. I.e. if the army moves, they will not be left behind as they are part of the army. If there is no army present, then they will form a garrison.\nIf the troops require a dock or port, then the Judge will try to find the best place to deploy them by looking for the largest city with port/dock, then highest loyalty. If no other suitable place is found, then they will be added to the capital (probably land locked).\nNew characters will not be able to receive actions on the first turn, but they will be available in the Counselor for the future turns.\nWhen the package offers a city upgrade, double agent or somehow selecting targets, these targets (for now) will be selected at random by the Judge. In the future, rules for selection and/or an offer of choice in the Counselor may be implemented.\nFor packages activates in future turns, usually they will activated during the "Market Adjustments and NPC Encounters" milestone.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.DUPLO=Recruit Double Agent
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DUPLO.CENARIO9=The character will try to convince the target to become a double agent.\nA double agent will share its results and information with both nations.\nMoreover, the double agent will not be as effective as usual against the hirer's nation in most aggressive actions as these will carry extra penalties. The double agent status would never affect spells or army actions, with the exception of the Dark Assassin spell. Being a double also doesn't affect the target\u2019s guard capabilities, except that it is very unlikely that a successful guarding action would end up in death of the aggressor from the hirer nation.\nA double agent will serve only one hiring nation at a time. If hired by someone else, no more information will be received by the former.\nIt is possible that someone from an inactive nation (or NPC) will join the diplomat\u2019s nation for good. Even beyond the hirer\u2019s character limit.\nThe attempt will be paid with gold from nation's treasury even if not successful.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.INFSEU=Influence Own City Loyalty
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.INFSEU.CENARIO7=Increases the city\u2019s loyalty by 1-10 points. Higher the loyalty, higher the defense of the city. If the loyalty is high enough, the visibility range of the city will be increased. There is a chance that the city will be reduced in size if the loyalty is too low.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.INFLEALDADE.CENARIO7=Reduce Enemy City's Loyalty
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.INFALH.CENARIO9=This action can reduce the population\u2019s loyalty by a dozen points or so in a city when there are no enemy armies at the hex. There is a chance that the population will abandon the city when the loyalty drops to a low level or they can even join your nation. Fortifications and the presence of characters may influence the chance of the city being abandoned by the population but have no effect on the chances of the city flipping to your side. If the population does abandon the city, the city will be reduced by one size each time. It is much easier to influence cities with your own culture. If the action is successful executed, it will improve the character\u2019s skill.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.DOCPORT.CENARIO6=Build Docks or Improve Dock to Port
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DOCPORT.CENARIO6=The city\u2019s population is commanded to build a dock or to improve existing dock to a port. \nThe builders will consume 2,500 gold pieces from nation\u2019s treasury and 5,000 units of wood from city\u2019s stores if building a dock. A dock cannot be built on camps or villages.\nIf the city already has a dock, a port will be built and it would consume 4,000 gold pieces from nation\u2019s treasury and 7.500 units of wood from city\u2019s stores. Only a burgh or metropolis can build a port.\nThe city must not be under siege.  It is possible to issue this command twice and get the port done in one single turn as long as all resources are available.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.AMPLCP=Improve City Size
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.AMPLCP.CENARIO6=The population is encouraged to move into the city, thus raising its size by one level. A city cannot change its size more than once per turn (up or down). \nSuccess depends on the character skill, city\u2019s loyalty and current city size, as it\u2019s harder to improve as cities get bigger.\nPopulation will not accept an order to move into a city if there are any enemy armies present.\n\nHere the cost to upgrade a city to the next level:\nCamp, 4,000.\nVillage, 6,000.\nTown, 8,000.\nBurgh, 10,000.\nThe upgrade will be paid with gold from nation's treasury only if successful.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.CRIARAC=Create Camp
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CRIARAC.CENARIO6=The population is invited to found a new city in a hex that does not have a city.\nPopulation not accept an order to create a new city if there is an enemy army present. \nSuccess depends on skill, but there is a limit on how many cities can exist at the same time. As the game gets closer to the total city's limit, this action gets harder to achieve.\n2,000 gold pieces will be deducted from the nation\u2019s treasury to cover for the start-up costs.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.CONTESP=Counter Espionage
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CONTESP.CENARIO9=The character tries to identify all double agents from the same nation in the same hex, if identified then the agent will be loyal again thus removing the double agent status. The success is based in the relative skills of the diplomat and the targets.\nThe attempt will be paid with gold from nation's treasury even if not successful.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.GUARLOC=Guard City
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.GUARLOC.CENARIO6=The character will try to protect the city from enemy\u2019s aggressive actions like stealing, sabotage, etc.\nAs a rule of thumb, a non-rogue guard would protect the target from an action of a non-rogue up to 2 times his main skill rank but there's luck involved. The same applies with rogue vs. rogue. A rogue would be able to protect the target vs. almost any non-rogue skill rank action.\nYes, death is a possible result to the guard or the aggressor. If the aggressor\u2019s skill is 85+, then the bodyguard will not be able to inflict enough damage to kill an aggressor with full health. Please, note that the aggressor will always receive at least 1 point of damage, on top of damage from other sources such as spell being cast that may lead to the aggressor\u2019s death.\nOverall, a rogue is more efficient as a guard. The guard will train on the same skill as the aggressive action\u2019s skill, even if the guard does not have the skill before. Therefore it is possible for the guard to acquire a new skill.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.GUARPER=Guard Character
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.GUARPER.CENARIO9=The character will act as a bodyguard and will try to protect another character from enemy\u2019s aggressive actions like assassination, stealing magic items, etc.\nAs a rule of thumb, a non-rogue guard would protect the target from an action of a non-rogue up to 2 times his main skill rank but there's luck involved. The same applies with rogue vs. rogue. A rogue would be able to protect the target vs. almost any non-rogue skill rank action.\nYes, death is a possible result to the guard or the aggressor. If the aggressor\u2019s skill is 85+, then the bodyguard will not be able to inflict enough damage to kill an aggressor with full health. Please, note that the aggressor will always receive at least 1 point of damage, on top of damage from other sources such as spell being cast that may lead to the aggressor\u2019s death.\nOverall, a rogue is more efficient as a guard. The guard will train on the same skill as the aggressive action\u2019s skill, even if the guard does not have the skill before. Therefore it is possible for the guard to acquire a new skill.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.ASSASS=Assassinate Character
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ASSASS.CENARIO9=The character will try to kill a character from another nation at the same hex. Mission failure can result in harm or death. Also, be aware of body guards protecting the target. If the assassin's skill level is 85 or more, death is not likely to occur unless the assassin is previously injured.\nIf the target is army\u2019s only commander, then the army will become a garrison.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.ASSASSE=Hire Assassins
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ASSASSE.CENARIO9=The character will try to poison (or cause an \u201caccident\u201d to) a character from another nation at the same hex. Mission failure can result in harm or death.  If the assassin's skill level is 85 or more, death is not likely to occur unless the assassin is previously injured. Also, be aware of body guards protecting the target.\nThe attempt will be paid with gold from nation's treasury even if not successful.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.SABFORT=Sabotage Fortifications
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.SABFORT.CENARIO9=Bribes will be given to some special workers to make allow some accidents happen to the fortification \u2026 someone may forget to lock the gates\u2026 There is a thing with bribed people\u2026 they tend to snitch on other people for their lives\u2026 and the guards protecting the area know how to extract this information and pay a surprise visit to the briber\u2026\nThe attempt will be paid with gold from nation's treasury only if successful.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.ROUBART=Steal Magic Item

DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.ROUBOUR=Steal Gold
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ROUBOUR.CENARIO6=Steal gold from another nation\u2019s city.\nMission failure can result in harm or death. Also, be aware of body guards protecting the city\u2019s treasury.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.ROUBNPC=Steal Gold and items
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ROUBNPC.CENARIO6=Steal gold or magical items.\nNote that this happens before guards are assigned to protect something.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.NOMPERS=Name New Character
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.NOMPERS.CENARIO9=Recruit a new character.\n\nWith this action, it is possible to recruit a new character with multiple skills or a single skill other than command using a commander.\nNew characters skills are limited to a total of 30 points (or whatever is the base for the game). Skills must be in multiples of 10. For example, naming a commander 10 rogue 10 diplomat 10 (10/10/10) is legal. Naming a 20/20 is not. Nor is 20/5/5. The game will adjust illegal skill amounts without failing the order. Such adjustments might not be what you wanted.\nStealth is not a skill, therefore cannot be chosen.\nThe action costs 10,000 units of gold. If the treasury doesn't have sufficient gold at the naming phase of the turn, the action will fail without cost.\n\nIn this scenario, one single nation can have up to 30 characters. Naming that exceeds the count will fail. This count is calculated at the start of the turn and doesn't include deaths or retirements during the turn. Wait till next turn to name replacement characters.\n\nEpic heroes cannot be replaced. New characters will have two action slots.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.NOMCOM=Name New Commander
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.NOMCOM.CENARIO9=A new commander can be recruited with the base skill rank for the scenario, but no greater than the PC\u2019s commander natural skill rank (without being modified by magic items) issuing the recruiting action. Some nations can have the ability to name better commanders.\nThe new PC will cost 5,000 unit of gold from the nation treasury.\nIn this scenario, one single nation can have up to 30 PCs.

All characters traveling together will move with the leader to new locations without the need of issuing movement actions.\nThere is no need for the leader to spend an action to create the group.\n\nCharacters from allied nations can travel with a leader as long as that leader isn't leading an army.\nNPCs can follow a leader even if the leader is an army commander.\n\nIf the leader tries to use movement spells or movement items, the order will fail and no one will move because the group cannot benefit from these.\n\nIf the character joining is leading a group, then the groups will be merged under the target leader. If the target is traveling with a group or an army, then both groups will merge under the target's leader as opposed to the target itself.\n\nIf the joining character is army commander, then the action will fail. Armies cannot be merged with this army nor can command be transferred.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.TRCOM=Transfer Command
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.TRCOM.CENARIO6=A group or army leader can transfer his command to another commander from the same nation at the same hex. All other people and troops traveling with the previous leader will be traveling with the new leader. The former leader has the option to keep traveling with the new commander or not.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.TAKECOM=Take Command of Garrison
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.TAKECOM.CENARIO6=A commander can take over the command of a garrison of the same nation at the same hex, converting it back to an army. Other characters traveling with the new commander automatically will join the army. The commander will not longer be traveling with someone if that\u2019s the case. If the character is currently commanding another army, the garrison will merge into the army.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.LARGART=Drop Magic Item
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.LARGART.CENARIO6=The listed magic items are dropped and hidden at the scene. It will be easier for the PC who hid them to pick them up. Harder for PCs from other nations.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.PEGNAV=Pickup Troops
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.PEGNAV.CENARIO6=A PC traveling with an army can pick up troops from the local garrison and add them back to the army, as long as they are from the same nation. If the PC is not traveling with an army, then a new army will be created under the command of the PC.\nIf the garrison is a navy on a hex that it cannot cast anchor, then only PC in a navy can pick up troops from the garrison as the troops will not be able to land to join a land army.\nUse the action \u201cTake Command of Garrison\u201d for all cases that the garrison is a navy in an hex that it cannot cast anchor to load or unload troops. Including where the goal is to convert the PC\u2019s land army into a navy.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.M.GRUPOS=-- Check Groups --
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.GRUPOS.CENARIO7=Check if the group is disbanded. A group is disbanded if the leader is traveling alone. The Judge will dismiss automatically any groups with 1 single person in it.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MOVPERS=Move Character
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVPERS.CENARIO11=The character will move to another hex up to 12 hexes away from the starting position. Any other people traveling with the character will move with the leader to the new hex.\nIf the character is commanding an army, then the movement action will fail.\nDestiny cannot be on water, but the path doesn\u2019t matter as they will find ways to move around obstacles, including water and mountains.\nNote that the distance is calculated from the hex before ANY movement occurs, so it's not possible to "launch" a PC by moving an army then moving the PC on top of it. i.e. the total combined distance covered in one turn has to be 12 or less.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.FEITMOV=Cast Movement Spell
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.FEITMOV.CENARIO11=A movement spell will be used by the wizard to increase the movement range by 1 hex for each 4 wizard\u2019s skill rank. If the wizard\u2019s skill rank is 100 or higher, the wizards can teleport to any valid destination. \nExample: A wizard with a skill rank of 50 will have a total range of 24 (12+12) for this movement, assuming a base move of 12 for the scenario. \nIf multiple spells are cast, they will fail.\nDestiny cannot be on water, but the path doesn\u2019t matter as they will find ways to move around obstacles, including water and mountains.\nIf there are any one else (characters, NPCs or army) traveling with him/her, the spell will fail.(i.e. Army or group leader)\nThe travel distance is calculated between the starting hex and the target hex.\nAll spells cast will drain life points from the caster according to the spells\u2019 difficulty and how many spells were cast in the same turn. Unfortunately it is not unusual to hear that some apprentice died while trying to cast too many hard spells.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MOVESQ=Sail (Move Navy)
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVESQ.CENARIO6=The army will board troops into available ships then move following the directions, hex by hex. It\u2019s possible to halt in a hex before continuing the movement by using the Halt direction.\nIf two navies are on the same hex at the same time and the diplomacy is not friendly (Peace/neutral still blocks movement), all movement will stop. The check is made at each completed step of every navy in the hex; therefore a Halt will force the check very early. i.e. if two enemies want to leave the hex, don\u2019t Halt, just leave. Then the first check will take place only after the fastest one left\nFor this scenario, a navy has 14 movement points to spend each turn in a single movement. The terrain, movement type and if there is enough food will affect the movement costs.\nStealthy movement means that the troops will make sure they left no trail behind the army and will be harder to be found by spies, but it slows down the troops' overall speed by doubling all costs.\nStealthy movement has no effect on armies blocking each other.\nAn army without food will pay an extra 33% in movement points for each movement, round up.\nJust try to move the army and the Counselor will help you to figure out the movement points for each step. Just make sure you choose the right options!\nYou can use the options to help the Counselor to figure out if the army will have food and the slowest ships you plan to have in your navy.\nAn army has to be fed during the upkeep phase to be able to move as fed, unless all troops in the army don't require food. There is no need to have at least 1 (one) food as long as the army was able to find enough food (city, foraging, etc.) during the upkeep phase. It is not enough to load the food into the army during the recruit action as it happens after the upkeep phase. While the army will load food during the recruit phase, the army will not be fed when this is checked during the upkeep phase as this occurs before the army recruits additional troops. This also applies when you have a fleet loaded/to be loaded onto an army. While most ships don't require food, the army does. Therefore, if your army + fleet is unfed then the ships will move at the unfed rate. \nWhen combining armies, the final army will move fed as long as the base army receiving troops was fed during the upkeep phase, even if the others were not fed at the upkeep phase.\nIf a navy engage in land combat for any reason, then the navy will drop anchor. This means that all ships will be removed from the army and left in the same hex as a garrison. This is important to understand as the ships cannot be transferred or somehow manipulated until they are attached back to the army, which can happen by an action to pick up the troops from the garrison or if an army without enough ships from the same nation receives the command to sail away. The Sail action will attach all ships back to the army, if the army does not have enough ships to sail, but a garrison in the same hex does.\nNavies can disembark troops onl on plain and shore terrain types, or in cities with docks or ports.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.BLOQ=Stand and Defend
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.BLOQ.CENARIO6=The army is commanded to block some exits from the hex. Any armies from other nations trying to leave the hex by the blocked paths will be forced to stop, unless they overrun the blocking army. \nThe blocked path will be the given direction plus the two adjacent ones. i.e.: If the army is blocking West, then SW and NW will be blocked as well.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MOVCITY=Move Khalasar
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVCITY.CENARIO11=The army commanders can order the Khalasar to move to an adjacent hex. The army will move with the Khalasar and the Khalasar can only move where the army could move. i.e. cannot cross big rivers or move from mountain to mountain when forbidden. Khalasar is always considered fed, so they can move on mountains even if without food.\nThe Khalasar cannot move into another city unless they are only ruins. A Khalasar is a nomad unfortified city with no constructions of any type, thus they will always leave the fortifications behind and any docks will be destroyed. Even conquered cities will adopt the Khalasar style and will be able to move.\nNote that the Khalasar moves before the army movement phase, so it is impossible to intercept them with moving armies. Also, any ships will be left behind in a garrison, only the army will move.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MOVEX=March (Move Army)
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVEX.CENARIO6=The army will move following the directions, hex by hex. It\u2019s possible to halt in a hex before continuing the movement.\nFor this scenario, an army has 12 movement points to spend each turn. The terrain, movement type, presence of infantry/cavalry and there is enough food will affect the movement costs.\nIf two armies are on the same hex at the same time and the diplomacy is not friendly (Peace/neutral still blocks movement), all movement will stop. The check is made at each completed step of every army in the hex; therefore a Halt will force the check very early. i.e. if two enemies want to leave the hex, don\u2019t Halt, just leave. Then the first check will take place only after the fastest one left\nStealthy movement means that the troops will make sure they left no trail behind the army and will be harder to be found by spies, but it slows down the troops' overall speed by doubling all costs.\nStealthy movement has no effect on armies blocking each other.\nAn army without food will pay an extra 33% in movement points for each movement, round up. Both effects are cumulative.\nJust try to move the army and the Counselor will help you to figure out the movement points for each movement. Just make sure you choose the right options such as food/stealthy\u2026 Also mind that different troops may have different movement costs.\nYou can use the options to help the Counselor to figure out if the army will have food and the slowest troops you plan to have in your army.\nAn army has to be fed during the upkeep phase to be able to move fed. There is no need to have at least 1 (one) food as long as the army was able to find enough food (city, foraging, etc.) during the upkeep phase. It is not enough to load the food into the army during the recruit action as it happens after the upkeep.\nWhen combining armies, the final army will move fed as long as the base army receiving troops was fed during the upkeep phase, even if the others were not fed at the upkeep phase.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MOVGAR=Npc March
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVGAR.CENARIO6=The NPC army will move following the directions, hex by hex. It\u2019s possible to halt in a hex before continuing the movement.\nRegular rules for troop\u2019s movement apply.\nA NPC army will look for a target they can beat.\nNPCs can move and attack with garrisons, they are fully functional only for NPCs.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.FORMARC=Force March (move army farther)
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.FORMARC.CENARIO6=The army will move following the directions, hex by hex. It\u2019s possible to halt in a hex before continuing the movement.\nFor this scenario, an army has 14 movement points to spend each turn when forcing march, but morale will drop every time the army forces the march.\nIf two armies are on the same hex at the same time and the diplomacy is not friendly (Peace/neutral still blocks movement), all movement will stop. The check is made at each completed step of every army in the hex; therefore a Halt will force the check very early. i.e. if two enemies want to leave the hex, don\u2019t Halt, just leave. Then the first check will take place only after the fastest one left\nThe terrain, movement type, presence of infantry/cavalry and there is enough food will affect the movement costs.\nStealthy movement means that the troops will make sure they left no trail behind the army and will be harder to be found by spies, but it slows down the troops' overall speed by doubling all costs.\nStealthy movement has no effect on armies blocking each other.\nAn army without food will pay an extra 33% in movement points for each movement, round up.\nJust try to move the army and the Counselor will help you to figure out the movement points for each movement. Just make sure you choose the right options such as food/stealthy. Also mind that different troops may have different movement costs.\nYou can use the options to help the Counselor to figure out if the army will have food and the slowest troops you plan to have in your army.\nAn army has to be fed during the upkeep phase to be able to move fed. There is no need to have at least 1 (one) food as long as the army was able to find enough food (city, foraging, etc.) during the upkeep phase. It is not enough to load the food into the army during the recruit action as it happens after the upkeep.\nWhen combining armies, the final army will move fed as long as the base army receiving troops was fed during the upkeep phase, even if the others were not fed at the upkeep phase.\n
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.M.MOVIMENTOS=-- Movements --
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.MOVIMENTOS.CENARIO7=All movements take place according to the action sequence. Armies usually have 12 movement points, but they can force movement to move 14 points at loss of morale. The movement costs are higher if the army doesn\u2019t have food in its baggage. A navy can move up to 14 points, but its movement ends if they land.\nArmy and navy movement are processed one step (1 to 14) at the time, and then each army will sequentially move within a given step in a random order. \nIf at any time an army is moving (consider that "Hold" is a move) into a hex, it triggers the interception check. The interception check checks ALL armies (moving or not) in the hex, and if and it finds a non-friendly army or fortification on the same hex, movement for all armies will be interrupted.\nThe army will move on the final step for the terrain. I.e. if it costs 5 points for an army to move to a new hex, then the army will wait for 4 steps, and then move into the new hex during the processing of step 5.\n\nOverrun:\nIn certain situations an army can be overrun by another army. \nThis happens when the ratio of army troops is more than 3 to 1. And the smaller army is 1000 troops or less.\nAn army of 2000 troops will over run an army of 500 troops. It doesn't matter what type of troops is in either army. \n\nTo get an overrun the larger army must move into the same hex as the smaller army and then try to move out of that hex. This means that the larger army must have the movement points and orders to do so, but it's ok if the army's movement is blocked by another army coming into the hex after the overrun. \n\nCertain units - for instance Wights and Mountain Giants can never be overrun no matter how outnumbered they are. But if they are 20% or less than the bigger army, then they will not block the enemy army as well.\n\nResults: \nThe larger army is unaffected. It does not spend any extra movement points and takes no casualties at all. It will get informed that it over ran an army in the results.\n\nThe smaller army is destroyed. All troops destroyed. Any and all characters traveling with the army could be killed. The stronger the character the less likely it will be killed.\n\nWhen the smaller army is trying a \u201cStand and Defend\u201d action, then the risks is higher (4:1 ratio) and the blocking army can be overrun if they have less than 1200 troops. Also, the odds of a character being killed are much higher.
DB.ORDEM.DESCRICAO.MOVUNIR=Move Character & Join Leader
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVUNIR.CENARIO11=The character will move to another hex up to 12 hexes away from the position at the start of the turn and then join the named character. \nIf the named character isn't available at the destination the movement still works. \nThe character can join a character who already commands an army or group. \nA character cannot move if it is currently commanding an army. Neither the move nor the join part of the action will happen with an army commander. \nThe destination hex cannot be on water, but the path doesn\u2019t matter as they will find ways to move around obstacles, including water and mountains.\nNote that the distance is calculated from the hex before ANY movement occurs, so it's not possible to "launch" a PC by moving an army then moving the PC on top of it. i.e. the total combined distance covered in one turn has to be 12 or less.
