#DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CRIGRUP.CENARIO6=Creates a group, allowing characters from a different nation to travel with him/her. The entire group will move with a single action commanded by the leader.\nIf the group is composed only by the leader, with no other characters, the group will be disbanded.\nNote that for characters from the same nation, this action is optional and all join actions will automatically create a group for the leader.
#DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.UNIREX.CENARIO6=The character starts traveling with another character in a group or army. All Characters traveling together will move with the leaders without the need of issuing movement commands.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ABANNAV.CENARIO6=This action, issued from your capital, will destroy your ships anchored anywhere on the map, preventing them from being captured and ending the ship\u2019s upkeep costs. The ships must be in a garrison, not part of an army.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.AMEACAR.CENARIO6=The army leader will give the city an ultimatum demanding the city\u2019s surrender.\nIf the population believes in the imminent threat, then they will drop their current flag and join the army\u2019s nation.\nSuccess depends on the army's attack strength, the number of troops in other armies of the same nation as the character issuing the ultimatum (although these armies contribute at much lower rate), army\u2019s leader commander skill, city\u2019s loyalty and fortifications.\nA massive amount of catapults seems to be quite effective to convince the population.\nThe mere presence of any army of the same nation as the city (or from a nation that considers the army as an enemy) at the point that the ultimatum takes place is enough to convince the population not to surrender.\nIf the army is strong enough to take the city by assault or if the army has siege weapons, then the city will go under siege and have a bigger loyalty drop even in an unsuccessful attempt.\nIn any case, the city\u2019s loyalty will drop as the population will not be happy to feel abandoned by their rulers to the whims of the enemies.\nNo that in Death Match games, the army will attack the enemy city if it\u2019s strong enough to capture it. The army will not wait until the ultimatum.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.AMPLCP.CENARIO13=The population is encouraged to move into the city, thus raising its size and fortification by one level each. A city cannot change its size more than once per turn (up or down). \nSuccess depends on the character skill, city\u2019s loyalty and current city size, as it\u2019s harder to improve as cities get bigger.\nPopulation will not accept an order to move into a city if there are any enemy armies present.\n\nHere the cost to upgrade a city to the next level:\n\tCamp, 4,000.\n\tVillage, 6,000.\n\tTown, 8,000.\n\tBurgh, 10,000.\nThe upgrade will be paid with gold from nation's treasury only if successful.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ANCNAV.CENARIO6=All ships will be removed from the army and will stay put at current location. Upkeep for these ships is still due.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ARTCMB.CENARIO1=This action allows the character to change the combat magic item that is in use.\nRemember, only one combat magic item can be active at any given time. Your first combat magic item will be always activated by default, so you only need to use this action if you have more than one and want to use the other one!\nAlso, you don\u2019t need to A magic item of the combat type will affect all combats the character in involved, both duels (by changing his challenge skill level) and army combats if the character is attached to an army, of course.\nThe magic item\u2019s effects will last until the magic item is stolen, dropped or changed by this order.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ARTMOV.CENARIO6=The character will use a magic item powers to issue a movement command.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ASSASS.CENARIO4=The character will try to kill a character from another nation at the same hex. Mission failure can result in harm or death. Guards protecting the target can decrease the chance of mission success and increase the change that the assassin will be hurt or killed.\n\nIf the assassin's rogue rank is below 75 then the mission is unlikely to succeed. Of course, there are other factors that can influence the outcome either way.\nIf the assassin's skill level is 85 or more, the assassin's death is not likely to occur even when the mission fails (unless the assassin is previously injured).\nIf the target is the army's only commander, then the army will be disbanded and all troops and luggage will be lost.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.ASSASS.CENARIO6=The character will try to kill a character from another nation at the same hex. Mission failure can result in harm or death. Guards protecting the target can decrease the chance of mission success and increase the change that the assassin will be hurt or killed.\n\nIf the assassin's rogue rank is below 75 then the mission is unlikely to succeed.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CHANGETERRAIN.CENARIO13=The terrain is changed to another land type. The original terrain must be empty of armies, features and cities. \nAll spells cast will drain life points from the caster according to the spells\u2019 difficulty and how many spells were cast in the same turn. Unfortunately, is not unusual to hear that some apprentice died while trying to cast too many hard spells.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CHGREL.CENARIO9.OLD=This action allows someone at the capital to change the diplomatic relationships with other nations. Vassals cannot declare war or peace with other nations, only their Lord can. But vassals can ally with friends or downgrade the relationship to Sworn/Hated Enemy to receive a greater bonus. On the other hand, it is much harder for the Lord to declare war or peace as the from all vassals' population will have to support the change.\nSome other actions are influenced by the relationship between the two nations. For example, only allies can form a group. Friends can engage battles on the same side. Armies and fortifications will stop neutral or enemy army\u2019s movements.\nArmy combat can only be initiated by an army against its enemies. Relationships have a heavy influence in combat. The farther the relationship is from neutral/peace, higher the bonus/penalties in combat.\nThe Lord/Vassal relationship have its obligations. The vassal must pay tribute to the Lord in gold and resources. The Lord is bound to protect their vassals, therefore able to recruit troops at any of their vassal\u2019s cities.\nIf a vassal rebels against their lord, war will be immediately declared between them. Also, there will be an overall loyalty drop on all cities from both Lord and Vassal and some of the vassal\u2019s troops may choose to remain at the service of their former lord.\nIf a lord dismisses a vassal from its service, the relationship will immediately change to peace/neutral and there will be an overall loyalty drop in all lords\u2019 cities and a boost on all vassals\u2019 cities.\nThe categories for this scenario are:\n At war with sworn enemy\n At war enemy\n Peace / Neutral\nFriend\nAlly\nVassal\nLord\nBilateral actions must be sent by both nations at the same time.\nThe attempt will be paid with gold from nation's treasury even if not successful.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CHGREL.CENARIO9=This action allows the capital's nation to change the diplomatic relationships with other nations.\nAs a rule of thumb, downgrading a relationship is a unilateral decision, but upgrading it is a bilateral agreement. It means that both nations need to successfully submit actions to sign a treaty (upgrade) on the same turn.\nNote that a nation cannot be both lord and vassal at the same time.\nThe possible relationship categories for this scenario are:\n\t- At war with sworn enemy\n\t- At war enemy\n\t- At Peace\n\t- Friend\n\t- Ally\n\t- Vassal\n\t- Lord\nThe categories above are in sequence from worst to best, from a downgrade/upgrade perspective.\nOnce a nation declares another as sworn enemy, it cannot be changed again for the length of the game.\nThe Ally status is reserved to nations pledging to the same lord, thus forming an alliance. A nation cannot reach the ally status by any other means as it cannot be directly declared. \nWhile pledging to a lord, the nation will become a vassal and the relationship with all other vassals from the same lord will be set to ally. After that, it is possible to drop form the ally status again even to war. But without leaving the alliance, there is not possible to sign an ally treaty again with that nation.\nFriend is the best relationship two nations can have unless they join an alliance (i.e. pledge to the same lord)\nVassals can declare war or peace with other nations, or rebel against its lord. Changes made by a lord will have no impact on vassal\u2019s relationships.\nThe Lord/Vassal relationship has its obligations. The vassal must pay tribute to the lord in gold and resources. The lord is bound to protect their vassals, therefore able to recruit troops at any of their vassal\u2019s cities.\nIf a vassal rebels against their lord, war will be immediately declared between them and the relationship will change to "Sworn Enemy". The relations with other nations from the same alliance will not be affected, other than the loss of the ally status down to friend. Also, there will be an overall loyalty drop on all lords\u2019 cities and an increase on all vassals\u2019 cities. Moreover, some of the vassal\u2019s troops may choose to remain at the service of their former lord.\nIf a lord dismisses a vassal from its service, the relationship will immediately change to friend. The relations with other nations from the same alliance will not be affected, other than the loss of the ally status down to friend. Also, there will be an overall loyalty drop in all lords\u2019 cities and a boost on all vassals\u2019 cities.\n
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CONPONT.CENARIO6=The city\u2019s population is commanded to build a bridge over an adjacent river. Both bridge\u2019s sides must be connected by a road. The builders will consume 5,000 gold pieces from nation\u2019s treasury and 2,500 units of wood from city\u2019s stores if building over a small river. If building over a big river, it will cost twice as much gold and wood. The city must not be under siege.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CONTESP.CENARIO6=The character tries to identify all double agents in the hex and convince them to be loyal again. The success is based in the relative skills of both rogues.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CRIARAC.CENARIO10=The population is invited to leave this city to found a new city in a hex that does not already have a city. A new camp will be created, and the original city will be reduced by one size. \nPopulation does not accept an order to create a new city if there is an enemy army present either at the origin or destiny hexes. \nA camp cannot create other camps. A camp cannot be created in a hex that contains a city or landmark.\nSuccess depends on loyalty, but there is an increasing difficult to create new cities based how many cities the faction already has and on time. The difficulty will increase over time. So, it is easier to place camps at the beginning of a game, harder to impossible towards the end game.\nThe difficulty will also increase according to how many cities a faction currently has. Fewer cities than average means easier, way more cities than average means virtually impossible to create a new city.\n2,000 gold pieces will be deducted from the nation\u2019s treasury to cover for the settlement and travel costs.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CRIARAC.CENARIO11=The population is invited to found a new city in a hex that does not have a city.\nPopulation does not accept an order to create a new city if there is an enemy army present. \nSuccess depends on skill, but there is an increasing difficult to create new cities based on time and how many cities the faction already has. \nThe difficulty will increase with the turns. So it is easier to place camps at the beginning of a game, harder to impossible towards the end game.\nThe difficulty will also increase according to how many cities a faction currently has. Fewer cities than average means easier, way more cities than average means virtually impossible to create a new city.\n2,000 gold pieces will be deducted from the nation\u2019s treasury to cover for the startup costs.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.CRIGRUP.CENARIO6=Deprecated action. Do not use.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DEFEND.CENARIO10=The army is commanded to hold its position in case of attack.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DSTCP.CENARIO6=The army is commanded to attack the enemy city at the same hex. The attack is mean to destroy the city if the attacking armies are strong enough.\nIf there are any defending armies or navies from the name nation as the city, a battle between the armies will take place and be resolved right before the attack on the city begins.\nAny defending allies must initiate the attack in order to be part of the city defenses.\nArchers will have double strength while defending their nation\u2019s city. Food will be captured by the winning side. All other troops will be destroyed.\nIf the defending armies are defeated and the attack on the city is initiated, the city will be considered under siege for the remaining of the turn even if not destroyed.\nIf the attacking armies win the battle against the city, the city will be razed to ruins with any improvements and stores. Only the fortifications will remain.\nAttacking catapults will have a free strike against the city\u2019s fortification before the city\u2019s attack, but after any armies\u2019 battles. If catapults are in enough numbers it is possible for them to reduce, or even remove a city\u2019s fortification.\nVictory will improve the skills of any chars traveling with the army. Also, it will improve the army\u2019s morale and training.\nOn the other hand, traveling with an army is risk business. All chars can be harmed or killed during combat, even if the combat is won.\nOf course, the city cannot be hidden for an enemy army to be able to attack it.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.DSTPONT.CENARIO6=The city\u2019s population or an army is commanded to remove a bridge. Don\u2019t forget to tell them which direction the bridge is (NW, NE, W, E, SW, SE).

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.FEITCMB.CENARIO6=The wizard casts a combat spell that will affect the upcoming armies\u2019 battles.\nAll spells cast will drain life points from the caster according to the spells\u2019 difficulty and how many spells were cast in the same turn.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.FEITMOV.CENARIO6=A movement spell will be used to by the character. If there are any other characters traveling with him/her, the spell will fail. The character cannot move if commanding an army.\nDestiny cannot be on water, but the path doesn\u2019t matter as they will find ways to move around obstacles, including water and mountains.\nAll spells cast will drain life points from the caster according to the spells\u2019 difficulty and how many spells were cast in the same turn. Unfortunately it is not unusual to hear that some apprentice died while trying to cast too many hard spells.\nSome NSPs or magic items may grant the ability to cast a particular spell even without the proper class or skills.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.GUARPER.CENARIO6=The character will act as a bodyguard and will try to protect another character from enemy\u2019s aggressive actions like assassination, stealing magic items, etc.\nAs a rule of thumb, a non-rogue guard would protect the target from an action of a non-rogue up to 2 times his main skill rank but there's luck involved. The same applies with rogue vs. rogue. A rogue would be able to protect the target vs. almost any non-rogue skill rank action.\nYes, death is a possible result to the guard or the aggressor. If the aggressor\u2019s skill is 85+, then the bodyguard will not be able to inflict enough damage to kill an aggressor with full health. Please, note that the aggressor will always receive at least 1 point of damage, on top of damage from other sources such as spell being cast that may lead to the aggressor\u2019s death.\nOverall, a rogue is more efficient as a guard.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.HIDESELF.CENARIO13=The character will try to hide from everyone\u2019s sight. If successful, no one will be able to interact with the target. In other words, any action that has the successfully hidden character as an explicit target will fail (.i.e. any actions that use the target\u2019s name as a parameter in the Counselor will fail).

If the population does abandon the city, the city will be reduced by one size each time. It is much easier to influence cities with your own culture. \nIf the action is successful executed, then it will improve the character\u2019s skill.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.INFALH.CENARIO7=This action can reduce the population\u2019s loyalty by a dozen points or so in a city when there are no enemy armies at the hex. There is a chance that the population will abandon the city when the loyalty drops to a low level or they can even join your nation. Fortifications and the presence of characters may influence the chance of the city being abandoned by the population.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.INFALH.CENARIO8=This action can reduce the population\u2019s loyalty by a dozen points or so in a city when there are no enemy armies at the hex. There is a chance that the population will abandon the city when the loyalty drops to a low level.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.CALCULOS.CENARIO10=Victory points are re-calculated.\nSome NPCs encounters take place. When a PC (character) is on the same hex as some NPC, an encounter can be triggered by a PC\u2019s action targeting the NPC to a result that can be either beneficial or negative depending on many factors.\nMagic Items\u2019 dormant powers usually activate at this time. Exceptions when the power affects combats, or effects such as good luck, where it makes no sense to have them at the end of the turn.\nMost troops and armies\u2019 powers usually activate at this time. Exceptions when the power affects combats, such as corruption and undead, where it makes no sense to have them at the end of the turn.\nFor startup packages activated in future turns, usually they will activated during this milestone.\nArmy relative sizes are re-estimated. All armies in the game are listen in a rank form the largest to the smallest. Then list\u2019s top 3% will receive the denomination of \u201cvast army\u201d, the other categories are applied in sequence up to the bottom 25% that will be defined as small army. The categories are: vast, huge, great, army and small army.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.CITYCOMBATES.CENARIO10=When the Judge reaches this milestone, all surviving armies will attack any enemy city located in the same hex. The Judge will resolve all city battles as follows.\n- Attacking army has defeated all enemy armies defending the city the Movement milestone.\n- Troops with siege ability will attack the fortifications, potentially reducing the city\u2019s defenses before the main attack begins.\n- Army will attack the city in a single round of combat. If the army\u2019s current attack force is greater than the city\u2019s defense, then the city is captured or destroyed, according to the command given. Spells and magic items bonuses might help the attacking army.\nIt is possible that the attacking army will conquer the city but be destroyed at the same time. The city will still be captured in this case.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.CUSTOMSTART.CENARIO10=This milestone is only applicable on games with custom startup packages.\nOnly on turn 0, the Counselor will offer a chance to select the startup packages. Look for the \u201cStartup Packages\u201d form in the \u201cNations\u201d tab.\nOn turn 1, BEFORE any other milestone or action is executed, the Judge will apply the effects of each package, and then proceed to execute all other actions for turn 1.\nWhen the package offers a way to somehow select targets, these targets shall be valid, else they will be selected at random by the Judge. \nFor packages that activate in future turns, usually they will activated during the "Market Adjustments and NPC Encounters" milestone.\n\n=== Custom startup package selection on turn 0, for turn 1 ===\nThere are many options to customize your nation. All packages are listed on the \u201cnations\u201d tab, which is only available on turn 0. \nThe packages can be a combination of special powers, extra troops, extra resources, characters or anything else. The startup packages cost 30, 60 or 90 points each. A player can select any combination of startup packages up to a total of 90 points. Meaning: 3x30, 30+60 or 1x 90.\nIMPORTANT: Please, mind that the Counselor is still evolving to better support the players. If an invalid selection is made (too many packages, invalid special, etc.) then the Judge will simply ignore the selection and the nation will have partial or no packages. The GM will not add them later to fix a player\u2019s mistake. Make sure you double check all your choices.\nEach package is self-explanatory; if you have questions, please ask your teammates or the GM team.\n\n=== Startup package execution on turn 1 ===\nOn turn 1, the Judge will apply all startup packages to each nation in the sequence established by the actions. This will be the very first to happen on turn 1 before anything else.\nMeaning that troops will show up, gold will be added to treasure, cities will appear, nation powers will be added, etc.\nUnless otherwise stated, troops will be added to the main city\u2019s army if there is one. If there is not, then a garrison will be created. And they will move or act as part of the army. I.e. if the army moves, they will not be left behind as they are part of the army. If there is no army present, then they will form a garrison.\nIf the troops require a dock or port, then the Judge will try to find the best place to deploy them by looking for the largest city with port/dock, then highest loyalty. If no other suitable place is found, then they will be added to the main city (possibly land locked and useless).\nNew characters will not be able to receive actions on the turn they are created, but they will be available in the Counselor for the future turns.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.DIPLOMACIA.CENARIO9.OLD=All diplomatic actions are processed. Bilateral pacts are signed. Unilateral changes and broken pacts are notified.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.DIPLOMACIA.CENARIO9=All diplomatic actions are processed. Bilateral pacts are signed. Unilateral changes and broken pacts are notified.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.GAMEOVER.CENARIO10=The Judge checks if any nation has the vassalage of all other active nations. Points are calculated.\nVictory Conditions: The nation with the allegiance of all other nations is declared the winner. Otherwise, the active nation (non-eliminated) with the highest score is declared the winner at the end of the timed game.\nThe game is over when one of the following conditions is met:\n- When all active nations are vassals to one single nation. (Only one Lord in the game)\n- After the limit of turns is reached.\n- When none of the nations received orders for the turn.\n- Special victory condition, as defined by the scenario, is met.\nA nation is eliminated at any time that one of the following conditions is met:\n- When all characters are dead or hold as hostages or unable to receive orders in any way.\n- When there is no city that's burgh or metropolis size.\n- When the player fails to send orders for three turns in a row.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.GAMEOVER.CENARIO7=The Judge checks if any nation was eliminated. Points are calculated.\nVictory Conditions: The active nation (non-eliminated) with the highest score is declared the winner at the end of the game in a free for all game. In a team game, the nation with the highest score on the winning side is declared the winner. If your team mate is eliminated, you lose, even if your nation has the highest score. Your team must win, if you want to win.\n\nThe game is over when one of the following conditions is met:\n- When one nation is eliminated.\n- After the limit of turns is reached.\n- When none of the nations received orders for the turn.\n- Special victory condition, as defined by the scenario, is met.\nA nation is eliminated at any time that one of the following conditions is met:\n- When all characters are dead or hold as hostages or unable to receive orders in any way.\n- When taxes are raised above 100% to pay the nation upkeep costs.\n- When the capital is lost and there is no other city that meets the minimum criteria to become a new capital. In most scenarios, this means burgh or metropolis size.\n- When the player fails to send orders for three turns in a row.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.INICIAL.CENARIO10=At this milestone, all characters automatically recover 14 life points if injured.\nAt this milestone, some NPCs encounters take place, according to their behavior.\n A few Magic Items\u2019 dormant powers may activate at this milestone. In particular the ones that affect combats, or effects such as good luck, where it makes no sense to have them at the end of the turn. \nEveryone\u2019s turn is processed together at the same time. The Judge will sort all actions sent by all players according to their sequence order, not the order the player saved them. Pay close attention to the order of events. This is how you will know when each of your orders will happen when turns are processed. When there are multiple actions on the same sequence step, then they are randomized expect for a few special cases.\n\nHere\u2019s a high level overview:\nThere are "First Events", then "Movement Events", and then finally "Last Events". \nThe First Events are things like NPC encounters, healing, duels and other aggressive actions which all happen before the Movement Events. \nThe Last Events are things like gaining revenue, etc., that all happen after Movement Events. \nFor example, changing issue a challenge happens in First Events, so this will happen before any movement. Also, city ownership change happens during Movement Events, so this is only after all First Events are. Gold revenues happen in Last Events, so this happens only after all movement and battles (in the Movement Events) are complete.\n\n\n=== The game in a nutshell, not really this milestone from now on ===\n\nThe game mechanics are easy to learn, but hard to master.\n\nYou will receive you turn results as a file. You use the Counselor program to open the file and review your results. Then, after consulting with potential allies, you use the Counselor to define your nation\u2019s next set of actions. Basically, you give orders to your nations through your characters, cities and armies (depending on the scenario\u2019s features). When you are ready, just send your orders to the Judge program. The Judge will process all actions from all nations and distribute the new turn results. Turn can be weekly, daily, even hourly\u2026 as long as all players are in agreement.\n\nPlease, be warned, the Judge has no tolerance for delays and will not wait for a player\u2026 the actions will be processed and sent as scheduled.\n\nYou hone your characters\u2019 skills, administer your nation, perform spy missions, raise and command armies and navies to battle. Sometimes you remove an opponent character by duel or assassination, even magic. Improve your cities and win through economic strength\u2026 or just destroy your opponents.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.MANUTENCAO.CENARIO10=Armies\u2019 upkeep is paid in gold. Troops will disband if not paid on time, lowest moral troops tend to leave first.\nTroops will leave (attrition) armies and garrisons depending on commander skill, being in a city and morale.\nLoans payments are also due at this phase.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.MOVIMENTOS.CENARIO10=All movements take place during this milestone. Also, all combats between armies will be resolved here.\nStandard armies have 14 movement points. Army\u2019s movements are processed one step (1 to 14) at the time, and then each army will sequentially move within a given step in a random order. \nThe army will move on the final step for the terrain cost. I.e., if it costs 5 points for an army to move to a new hex, then the army will wait for 4 steps, and then move into the new hex during the processing of step 5.\nA fortified city will block enemy and neutral armies passing through but will not affect friendly armies. On the other hand, an unfortified city has no effect on any army\u2019s movement.\nOnce the movement for all armies are resolved for a given step, then combats will be triggered. See combat section below for more details.\nIt is possible for the same army to have multiple combats during a turn as the enemies will be found along the movement path. After the combat is completed, the remaining armies will remain still (Hold) for another point per round of combat. In other words: Combats will cost 1 point per turn, a 5-turn combat will cost 5 movement points.\nThere is no overrun. Combat is always triggered in these cases.\nIf a navy moves by sailing, then it will not engage any land armies in its path. Land armies will not engage embarked navies. If an army contains both naval and land troops and is not moving, then it will engage both navies and land armies passing through the hex.\nOf course, it is possible that an army will have enough ships sunk to be forced to disembark troops, essentially becoming a land army.\n\n-- COMBATS --\nWhen an army combat is triggered, the Judge resolves battles between armies as follows.\nThe combat is resolved at the end of each step, for all hexes that contain two or more enemy armies. Enemy armies always engage in combat.\nThe combat is executed in rounds. \nFor each round, the attack force is used to calculate the damage dealt to the opposing side, reducing its defense force (killing soldiers). The tactics are used to determine the attack and defense sequence. i.e. each of the attacker's troops will cause damage calculated as below and applied to the defenders. Many special bonuses may apply here, such as \u201cElf bonus vs Spiders\u201d. Read killing enemies below.\nAll troops will deal damage before being removed as casualties at the end of the round. It is possible that both sides eliminate each other in each round.\nSome units have the first strike ability, like archers, allowing them one extra attack before the battle begins. They are the only troops that will cause any damage in the combat\u2019s round 0. \n\n-- Calculating attack and defense values --\nThe army\u2019s attack and defense forces are calculated by adding up all platoons\u2019 attack and defense, respectively.\n The formula to calculate a platoon attack is: (Unit attack for the terrain) * ((commander\u2019s skill + moral + weapons + training + 300)/700) * (# of troops)\nThe formula to calculate a platoon defense is: (Unit defense for the terrain) * ((armor + 100)/100) * (# of troops)\nSpells, magic items, special powers, and NPCs may provide different bonuses to be added to the army\u2019s total. \nDiplomatic relations and tactics vs. tactics selections come in last, as overall modifiers.\n\n-- Calculating casualties\u2026 killing enemies --\nEach round, the Judge will\n1. Sort all platoons in each army according to respective tactics\n2. List all armies from stronger to weaker for each side/team\n3. Select first platoon from first army of each side then\n4. Calculate attack and defense values then resolve the platoon vs platoon combat from previous step \n5. Eliminate defeated platoon and then move the next platoon to the combat slot then execute step 4 again until there are no more enemy platoons to fight \n\nNote on Combat Tactics:\nEach army commander can give orders to the army regarding which tactic to use when engaging the enemy on the battlefield. All platoons will perform the same (there is no better troop per tactics) but casualties\u2019 sequence will be assigned according to the tactics than another. If the commander never specifies the tactics before, the army will engage all enemies in a pre-set formation. Once defined, the army will use the same tactics in future turns until a new order is given to change it. Look for a tactics vs. tactics table in the rulebook.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.PRODUCAO.CENARIO10=This step is for any gold left in your treasury to decay. At this time, 7% of the gold in your treasury will now decay, which represents pilfering, and frivolous expenses by your ruler as he lives the high life.\nAfter the decay, all cities will yield revenue from taxes to your main treasury (which the inhabitants have worked hard all season long to produce).\nThe conditions for producing revenue are:\n- A city will only yield income directly to your treasury if you own it. \n- A city under siege (or combat) does not gather any resources, including gold and taxes (there is too much disorganization across the countryside of that city).\nFinally, the loyalty is adjusted for all cities, based on current taxes. City decay and flip is checked. Cities were the loyalty is too low may leave your nation and join the barbarians. On the other hand, cities with very high loyalty may result in nice surprises.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.REFENS.CENARIO7=Hostages try to escape.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.M.TRIBUTO.CENARIO10=At this point, the Judge will collect from the vassal 10% of all stored gold from the treasury, and transfer them to the suzerain\u2019s treasure.\nNo gold will be transferred if you are not a vassal. No gold will be received if you are not a vassal\u2019s lord.\nA rebellion against your lord will stop any tributes from being paid.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MANEX.CENARIO6=The army training stats can be raised (1-10) by executing training maneuvers with the army. Not only will the army train, but all commanders (1-5) traveling with the army as well if the army leader is commanding the maneuvers. If a commander traveling with the army is commanding the maneuvers, then only his/her skill will improve (1-7). Note that it is possible for different commanders at the same army to use this action multiple times each turn. The effects will stack.\nNavy cannot train if they cannot anchor.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MANWALL.CENARIO10=City's population will man the walls and temporarily increase city's defense by a cumulative 20% for combats in the current turn. The amount increase depends on loyalty, size and fortifications. It is not a permanent bonus and the effect lasts until the end of the turn.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVCITY.CENARIO9=The army commanders can order the Khalasar to move to an adjacent hex. The army will move with the Khalasar and the Khalasar can only move where the army could move. i.e. cannot cross big rivers or move from mountain to mountain when forbidden. The Khalasar cannot move into another city, but it can if there are only ruins. A Khalasar is a nomad unfortified city with no constructions of any type, thus they will always leave the fortifications behind and docks will be destroyed. Only available on cities where the predominant culture is Targaryen/Dorthraki. 
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVCOMB.CENARIO10=The army will move following the directions, hex by hex. Combat any armies found on the movement path and capture any cities at the end of movement.\nArmies will battle every time they end a step of movement at the same hex, but it does not interrupt the movement \u2026 except for the defeated armies, of course.\nIf the army is at an enemy city at the end of the movement, then it will try to capture it during the \u201ccity combat\u201d milestone, after all other combats are resolved.\nFor this scenario, an army has 14 movement points to spend each turn. The terrain, troop\u2019s type and roads will affect the movement costs. If the army engages in a combat during movement, it will cost an additional point per each combat round. (i.e. 3 rounds of combat will cost +3 points)\nIt\u2019s possible to halt in a hex before continuing the movement to introduce a controlled pause to the movement. \nA fortified enemy city will interrupt the army\u2019s movement. \nJust try to move the army and the Counselor will help you to figure out the movement points for each step of the movement.  Mind that different troops may have different movement costs in different situations.\nPlease, note that the Counselor will not add any movement points due combats to the simulations as it is impossible to forecast how long it will last or even where they will happen.\nSee the Movement milestone for more details.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVEARMYMOUNTAIN.CENARIO11=The wizard enchants 20 troops per wizard\u2019s skill rank that will be able to move from a mountain hex to another on the army the caster is traveling with. \nExample: A wizard with a skill rank of 50 will have 1000 troops able to cross mountain terrain for the duration of the turn.\nIf multiple spells are cast, their effects will be added together.\nAll spells cast will drain life points from the caster according to the spells\u2019 difficulty and how many spells were cast in the same turn. Unfortunately, is not unusual to hear that some apprentice died while trying to cast too many hard spells.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVPERS.CENARIO2=Move Character
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVPERS.CENARIO6=The character will move to another hex up to 8 hexes away. Any other people traveling with the character will move with him/her to the new hex.\nThe character cannot move if commanding an army.\nDestiny cannot be on water, but the path doesn\u2019t matter as they will find ways to move around obstacles, including water and mountains.\nNote that the distance is calculated from the hex before ANY movement occurs, so it's not possible to "launch" a character by moving an army then moving the character on top of it. i.e. the total combined distance covered in one turn has to be 8 or less.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVRAZE.CENARIO10=The army will move following the directions, hex by hex. Combat any armies found on the movement path and raze any cities at the end of movement.\nArmies will battle every time they end a step of movement at the same hex, but it does not interrupt the movement \u2026 except for the defeated armies, of course.\nIf the army is at an enemy city at the end of the movement, then it will try to capture it during the \u201ccity combat\u201d milestone, after all other combats are resolved.\nFor this scenario, an army has 14 movement points to spend each turn. The terrain, troop\u2019s type and roads will affect the movement costs. If the army engages in a combat during movement, it will cost an additional point per each combat round. (i.e. 3 rounds of combat will cost +3 points)\nIt\u2019s possible to halt in a hex before continuing the movement to introduce a controlled pause to the movement. \nA fortified enemy city will interrupt the army\u2019s movement. \nJust try to move the army and the Counselor will help you to figure out the movement points for each step of the movement.  Mind that different troops may have different movement costs in different situations.\nPlease, note that the Counselor will not add any movement points due combats to the simulations as it is impossible to forecast how long it will last or even where they will happen.\nSee the Movement milestone for more details.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVROAD.CENARIO10=The army will move following the directions, hex by hex. Combat any armies found on the movement path and capture any cities at the end of movement.\nThe army will construct roads will also construct a road along the movement path where there is none.\nArmies will battle every time they end a step of movement at the same hex, but it does not interrupt the movement \u2026 except for the defeated armies, of course.\nIf the army is at an enemy city at the end of the movement, then it will try to capture it during the \u201ccity combat\u201d milestone, after all other combats are resolved.\nFor this scenario, an army has 14 movement points to spend each turn. The terrain, troop\u2019s type and roads will affect the movement costs. If the army engages in a combat during movement, it will cost an additional point per each combat round. (i.e. 3 rounds of combat will cost +3 points)\nIt\u2019s possible to halt in a hex before continuing the movement to introduce a controlled pause to the movement. \nA fortified enemy city will interrupt the army\u2019s movement. \nJust try to move the army and the Counselor will help you to figure out the movement points for each step of the movement.  Mind that different troops may have different movement costs in different situations.\nPlease, note that the Counselor will not add any movement points due combats to the simulations as it is impossible to forecast how long it will last or even where they will happen.\nSee the Movement milestone for more details.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MOVUNIR.CENARIO6=The character will move to another hex up to 8 hexes away and then join the named character. \nIf the named character isn't available at the destination the movement still works. \nThe character can join a character who already commands an army or group. \nA character cannot move if it is currently commanding an army. Neither the move nor the join part of the action will happen with an army commander. \n\nIf the character joining is leading a group, then the groups will be merged under the target leader. If the target is traveling in a group or an army, then both groups will merge under the target's leader as opposed to the target itself. \nThe destination hex cannot be on water, but the path doesn\u2019t matter as they will find ways to move around obstacles, including water and mountains.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MUDIMP.CENARIO10=Inform to your tax collectors how much they would take away from the population.\nHigher the taxes, higher the stead income from cities and faster the city\u2019s loyalty will drop each turn. Lower taxes will increase loyalty each turn. Moreover, when the population first hears that the taxes are being raised, the loyalty immediately will drop in each city. If the taxes are being lowered, the opposite effect will be noticed.\nTaxes will not be raised automatically. If a nation, at any time, doesn\u2019t have enough gold in its treasury to pay for its upkeep, then troops will disband and other assets will be lost. Costs associated with actions will not force the taxes up, but the action will fail for lack of funds.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.MUDIMP.CENARIO6=Inform to your tax collectors how much they would take away from the population. Higher the taxes, higher the stead income from cities and faster the city\u2019s loyalty will drop each turn. Lower taxes will increase loyalty each turn. Moreover, when the population first hears that the taxes are being raised, the loyalty immediately will drop in each city. If the taxes are being lowered, the opposite effect will be noticed.\nIf a nation, at any time, doesn\u2019t have enough gold in its treasury to pay for its upkeep, the taxes will be raised automatically to find the funds. Costs associated with actions will not force the taxes up, but the action will fail for lack of funds. In this case, the loyalty drop on all cities is even bigger due the acknowledgement of poor administration by the regent.\nATTENTION: if at any given moment the taxes are raised above 100%, the nation is considered eliminated from the game.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.NOMAGEN.CENARIO6=A new rogue can be recruited with the base skill rank for the scenario, but no greater than the character\u2019s rogue skill rank issuing the recruiting action. Some nations can have the ability to name better rogues or rogues with higher chance of having stealth. The stealth is based on the nation ability and the stealth rank of the character issuing the action.\nThe new character will cost 5,000 gold pieces from the nation treasury.\nIn this scenario, one single nation can have up to 20 characters. Naming that exceeds the count will fail. This count is calculated at the start of the turn and doesn't include deaths or retirements during the turn.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.PRODINC.CENARIO2=Production Increased
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.PRTMGS.CENARIO6=The wizard improves its skill (1-5) by training in a nation\u2019s city.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.PSQFEIT.CENARIO6=To be able to learn new spells, the character must know a pre-requirement spell from the same tome as follows:\n\nIf the spell\u2019s difficult is easy, there are no pre-requirements. All can be learned.\nIf the difficulty is average, then the character must know an easy spell from the same tome.\nIf the difficulty is hard, then the character must know an average spell from the same tome.\n\nIn other words: To learn a new spell list, the character must always start with an easy spell. If the character knows any easy spell from a given list, the character can learn a spell from the same list. Knowing an average spell enables the character to learn a hard one from the same list...\n\nSome tomes are forbidden; the character must have access to it by a nation\u2019s ability, magic item or any other means to learn even the easiest spell.\nA character can learn a new spell with the proper skills, or depending on certain magic items or Faction Special Powers (FSP). Also, it's possible that a NPC will teach a spell to a character.\nSome NSPs or magic items may grant the character the ability to learn a particular spell regardless of the list pre-requirements. Sometimes, they may grant the ability to cast a particular spell even without the proper class or skills.\n\nA new spell can only be learned at one of the nation\u2019s city and it will cost 1,000 gold pieces from the nation\u2019s treasury.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.RECTROPAS.CENARIO10=Troops can be recruited from the city militia into the nation\u2019s army. If the commander cannot be found, then the troops will join in a garrison.\nThere is no cost for creating a new army, but most troops require some gold in advance for general equipment.\nThe city will recruit up to 100 troops with each action, depending on the availability of gold and requested quantity. Multiple recruit actions are possible by the same city.\nA city under siege will not provide any troops to armies. \nIf the quantity of troops is not informed, the Judge will assume that the intention is to recruit the maximum amount. 
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.RECTROPAS.CENARIO13=Troops can be recruited from the city militia into the nation\u2019s army. If the character is not traveling with an army, one army will be created under his/her command. If other characters are traveling with him/her, they will automatically be traveling with the army.\n\nThere\u2019s no cost for creating a new army other than the cost of the troops themselves. \n \nThe amount of troops that can be recruited in a given city at the same turn is limited to the militia size and available resources. A city under siege will not provide any troops to armies. Troops can only be recruited in the big cities (burghs and metropolis).\nThe city will contribute troops only when loyalty is higher than 50 and the city has the same culture as the nation.\nA city is able to provide troops to armies as bellow:\n\tBurgh: 400 troops.\n\tMetropolis: 500 troops.\nMultiple recruit actions are possible at the same city, but they all count against the same limit. Remember that the order that the recruit action is executed is random. \n\nYes, any troops will be considered units and count against this limit, including ships and catapults.\n\nWhen recruiting troops with better armor or weapons, they are becoming more powerful and efficient with a higher attack or defense force. Of course, you need to have enough available resources in the city\u2019s stores: One unit of the resource for each troop recruited.\n\nIf the quantity of troops is not informed or zero, the Judge will assume that the intention is to recruit the maximum amount. If your intention is to load food but not recruit troops, make sure you chose a troop type that cannot be recruited at the moment, such as ships and catapults when no wood is present, or cavalry when mounts are not available.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.REMDOCAPORT.CENARIO6=The city\u2019s population is commanded to remove the docks or port present in the city.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.SABPONT.CENARIO6=If successful, the unguarded bridge is destroyed.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.SCRYCITYNATION.CENARIO10=The diplomat will try to find out a summary of city\u2019s nation\u2019s major cities. It is possible to receive information like name, size, fortifications, docks, and hex. \nInformation will be paid with gold from nation's treasury even if not successful.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.SENDMONEY.CENARIO10=Gold can be transferred from the treasury to another nation. The city cannot be under siege to send the gold. 10% of the resources will be deduced before the transfer to pay for the transportation. 
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.SETTACTIC.CENARIO10=The tactic selected is communicated to everyone in the army. It does not initiate combat by itself, but defines which tactic will be used for all combats until further orders are issued to change it again is future turns.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.SITCP.CENARIO6=The army is commanded to lay siege to the enemy non-hidden city. If successful, no resources or taxes will be received or sent from or to the city. Most construction work and creation of new armies will fail as well.\nThe city under siege will also suffer a reduction in loyalty and at very low levels there will be a chance that the city will surrender and join the army\u2019s nation.\nThis command does not initiate combat between armies and city.\nIf the army has enough war machines, the fortifications can be reduced as part of the siege.\nSuccess is based on the army\u2019s size, the size of other allied armies in the hex (although these armies contribute at a much lower rate of the sieging army), commander\u2019s skill, city\u2019s loyalty, city\u2019s size and fortifications.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.SUBORNO.CENARIO6=The target is bribed to act as a double agent reporting some information back to the briber. If the target belongs to a dead nation or no nation and if it does not command an army, it can join your nation instead of becoming a double agent.

DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.S.SP049=The City Upgrade startup package gives you 5 parameter slots to select which cites to improve.  Each upgrade's parameter slot will increase both the size and fortifications of a city, but any that exceed the maximum are lost.  You can apply more than one parameter slot to the same city.  For instance, a package with two parameter slots selected for the same village/none would make it a burgh/fort.\nIf an invalid hex (without a city, or a city form other nation) is selected, then the Judge will make random selections to apply the upgrades.

And be resolved in the sequence that parameters were entered.\nIt's possible to select 5 non continuous hexes to create smaller extensions, or to have 5 in a row (in the proper sequence) for a longer stretch.\nAs each segment (parameter) is executed in order and individually, any hex (parameter) without connections to other road segments at the time it is processed by the Judge will fail. And this may lead to a sequence of failures. Pay extra attention to the sequence of parameters. \nRoads over a river will not create a bridge.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.TRANPOP.CENARIO10=The population is encouraged to move from this city into another target city within 3 hexes of distance, thus raising target\u2019s size by one level. In the process, the city of origins will lose two levels of size.\nSuccess depends on the city\u2019s loyalty and current city size, as it\u2019s harder to improve as cities get bigger.\nPopulation does not accept an order to move into a city if there are any enemy armies present at origin or destiny.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.TRCAP.CENARIO6=Move the capital palace to a new city from the same nation. 25,000 gold pieces are spent in the new palace\u2019s renovations.

The city cannot be hidden or under siege.\nThe target nation cannot be enemy. The city cannot be occupied by enemy armies.\nThe chances of success are higher depending on city's loyalty.\nThe resulting loyalty will be impacted according to city\u2019s culture. If the city is being transferred back to a nation of the same culture, then loyalty will raise. Otherwise, loyalty will drop.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.UNIREX.CENARIO6=Deprecated action. Do not use.
DB.ORDEM.AJUDA.UPGWARRIORS.CENARIO13=The commander will promote warriors to riders consuming mounts from the city.
